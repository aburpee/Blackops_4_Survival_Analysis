## Problem Statement 
In this project I will pull reddit comments from the day Call of Duty: Blackops 4 came out until present day. Using this data, plus the data from regular patches and updates, I will provide insight into when new patches and updates should be released based on user feedback of the game at hand and how past patches corrected or failed to correct issues. I will be using a combination of sentiment analysis and time series data to create my models. 

I plan to measure my success or failure by comparing my model's predictions to past patches and updates, as well as any updates that come in between now and the completion of this project.
